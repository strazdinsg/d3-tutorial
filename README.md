# D3.js tutorial

This tutorial was created as part of course "Data processing and visualizatoin" at NTNU, Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
See course description here: www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/IE500417/

The whole tutorial is example based. Look at the example HTML files ordered by filename: 01-..., 02-... 

The tutorial builds from ground up: starting with HTML and CSS basics, some Javascript programming principles, and then goes into D3.js.

There are not too many comments. If you feel lack of explanation, consider other tutorials or search StackOverflow. Tutorial by Dashing is recommended as a good one to fill in more details: https://www.dashingd3js.com/table-of-contents . It is a bit outdated, but covers most topics step-by-step.
