<!-- You can write comments in HTML in blocks like this one -->

<!--

HTML consists of Head and Body sections. Head is where you include some scripts, styles and configuration

You build the content blocks in the Body.

P.S. A proper HTML file will have some more specific syntax: DOCTYPE, character set, etc. Here we skip it
for simplicity.


 -->
<head>
    <!-- This is the title for the site -->
    <title>Our first site</title>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Here you can put some content. All the content is organized as HTML Elements. Each element
 is defined as a TAG, for example: Paragraph <p>, a block <div>, or a first-level heading <h1>, etc.
  -->

<p>This is our first paragraph.</p>

<!-- We open tags with <tagName> and close with </tagName>. See the paragraph tag above as an example -->

</body>

</html>
<!-- The whole page is enclosed in HTML tag -->
