<p>
    The whole website consists of hierarchical tags, also known as DOM Elements.
    This example demonstrates how we include HTML elements inside each other.
</p>

<p>
    It is quite hard to understand the DIV boundaries. We will see it much better in the next
    example where we add some style to the boxes.
</p>

<div>
    This is our main Div element.

    <div>
        This is child Div #1.
    </div>

    <div>
        This is child Div #2. It contains one heading and three paragraphs inside it.
        <h1>This is the heading.</h1>
        <p>This is child paragraph #1 inside Div #1.</p>
        <p>This is child paragraph #2 inside Div #1.</p>
        <p>This is child paragraph #3 inside Div #1.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        This is child Div #3. It contains two Span elements inside it.
        <span>This is the first span.</span>
        <span>This is the second span.</span>
    </div>
